## Outside of Work

When I'm not working on robots, I love spending time outdoors and staying active. You can find me:

🏔️ **Hiking** in the mountains  
🎾 **Playing tennis** with friends  
🏃‍♂️ **Running** to clear my mind  
🏋️ **Working out** to stay strong  

Always seeking new adventures, both in robotics and in life! 🚀
