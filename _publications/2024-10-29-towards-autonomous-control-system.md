#Abstract

This article aims to describe the implementation of an autonomous control system for the Brazilian Navy's Unmanned Surface Vehicle Laboratory (USV-Lab) using the MOOS-IvP framework. The main goal of this project is to enable an existing vehicle to be a laboratory for research of maritime autonomous systems, to perform unmanned maritime missions, following desired routes without human intervention or being remotely piloted. The paper starts with the importance of autonomous maritime vehicles and presents MOOS-IvP framework as a validated tool for autonomous maritime systems development. In succession, the main objectives are set, the physical system and components are shown and the proposed software and communication are structured. The work comprises the development of control interface, the integration of sensors and actuators, the tuning PID controllers, and specific software settings, along with several hardware modifications. The methodology consisted in progressive testing, from simulations to local operations as made in Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro and Bay of All Saints in Bahia. Results revealed the system's effectiveness and robustness in maintaining configured routes, enabling its use in a Brazilian Navy military reconnaissance exercise, as well as serving as a laboratory for future research.
